# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
So far, I’ve delved into Object-Oriented Programming, which focuses on creating classes and objects to organize data and behavior. Some key concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

# Data Structures
I learned that data structures are the foundation of how computers store and organize data for fast access. Depending on the nature of the data and the operations needed to be performed, choosing the right data structure is important.
Some examples of data structures that we went over:
1. Record
2. Array
3. Linked list
4. Binary tree
5. Hash table
6. Heap
7. Graph
Data structures are extremely important for: efficiency, versatility, and problem solving.
# Algorithms
I learned that another key aspect of learning Python is understanding algorithms, which are step by step instructions for solving problems. Designing an efficient algorithm requires balancing speed (time complexity) and resource use (space complexity). Algorithms should be designed to perform tasks in a reasonable time with limited resources. For example, I've learned about NP-complete algorithms, a category of problems where no fast solutions are known. If one NP-complete problem can be solved quickly, then all of them can be.
# Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
ADTs describe data structures in terms of operations without specifying how they’re implemented. They allow us to focus on what operations can be performed rather than how they are executed.
